# Docker can be useful to test an application thatâ€™s still being developed without polluting your libraries. You will have to design a Dockerfile that gets the development
# version of Gitlab - Community Edition installs it with all the dependencies and the necessary configurations, and launches the application, all as it builds. The container will be
# deemed valid if you can access the web client, create users and interact via GIT with this
# container (HTTPS and SSH). Obviously, you are not allowed to use the official container
# from Gitlab, it would be a shame...

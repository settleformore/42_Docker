#--Ex:--
#Launch a mysql container as a background task. It should be able to restart on its
#own in case of error, and the root password of the database should be Kerrigan.
#You will also make sure that the database is stored in the hatchery volume, that
#the container directly creates a database named zerglings, and that the container
#itself is named spawning-pool.

docker run -d --restart on-failure -e MYSQL_DATABASE=zerglings -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=Kerrigan --name spawning-pool -v hatchery:/var/lib/mysql mysql
